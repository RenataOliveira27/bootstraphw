                <p>Video gaming is my passion. I remember back in high school sprinting home and locking myself in the basement until the early hours of the morning playing Call of Duty. I beat opponents six to one. I ranked #273 in the world at one point. One of the reasons why I was so good is because I would camp out and observe how players interacted on the game. I knew how groups moved and where they went. I knew when to throw my bomb at the precise second to win. Most people tend to follow a pattern, and I liked figuring out what those were in order to gain an advantage. Today, I am mastering Red Dead Redemption and Battlefield V. I play with friends in Brazil on their slow servers. My ping is at a three hundred, but I still win because I anticipate their every move. I don’t regret all of the time I spent gaming instead of learning how to code when I was younger. Instead, I’m grateful for what I’ve learned through gaming and believe I could build something truly amazing as I acquire new coding skills. I also know that I am capable of sitting in front of a screen for hours, something that will come in handy as I learn to code!</p>
